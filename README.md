# Yeoman Generator for Redux Logic Projects

This generator can be used with (Yeoman)[] to create and scaffold objects for
projects using `react`, `redux`, and `redux-logic`. The generator will also
create generic tests.

This generator uses the `react-scripts` package from `create-react-app`, ie all
`create-react-app` commands and expectations apply here. See [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts) for details.

The following packages are installed when using the scaffold to instantiate
a project:

- `axios`
- `react`
- `redux`
- `redux-logic`
- `prop-types`
- `jest`
- `enzyme`
- `redux-logic-test`

## Dependencies

- `node` (_testing on v9.11.1_)

## Installation

Install Yeoman and the generator:

`npm install -g yo generator-redux-logic`

## Usage

### Create a new project

```sh
yo generator-redux-logic <project name>`
```

Example:

```sh
yo generator-redux-logic my-project
```

### Scaffold objects on an existing project

> Only works in a project folder that already follows the logic and file pattern
of a project generated by this generator

### Create a reducer and generic actions

```sh
yo generator-redux-logic:reducer <camelCaseReducerName>
```

Example:

```sh
yo generator-redux-logic:reducer monkeyMen
```

### Create an asynchronous reducer, generic actions, and generic logics

```sh
yo generator-redux-logic:reducer <camelCaseReducerName> -a
```

Example:

```sh
yo generator-redux-logic:reducer spaceMonkeyMen -a
```
